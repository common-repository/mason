1. check for when container is called by a shortcode, but contaiiner doesnt exist - report error somehow
2. 559 class-mason.php check: //				if( in_array( preg_replace('/_block/','',$module_name), $included_modules ) ){
					$container_layouts[] = $this->layouts[$module_name];
//				} 
3. need to iterate over the field to get the conditional field as lang
4. language toggle added (shortcode)
5. consider styling sheets and enque path in settings (either enqueue default .css from each module OR path for a combined css
6. an edit link when logged in that opens that block and scrolls to it
